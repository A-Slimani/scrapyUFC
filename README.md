# UFC SCRAPER 
- Scrapes previous fights and fighter info

## TODO
- Make this run periodically in the background (with my server) <- Completed ensure it works
- Find a way to automatically add new fighters if they dont exist in the fighter table
    - Add their link to missing_fighters.csv <-- Complete: check if works
- ufcall -> update existing records
- Create a discord bot that provides updates for this
